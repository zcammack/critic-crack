# critic-crack
This is the final project for Flatiron School. The program implements React/Redux frontend software with a Ruby on Rails API backend. 

Critic Crack is an application built to keep custom made reviews and ratings for various films in an easy to use and navigate environment.

To use the application, fork and clone this repository.

Navigate to backend, and then to critic-crack-api.

Run 'bundle install' to download and install dependencies.

Run 'rails db:migrate' to setup migration tables.

Run 'rails db:seed' to seed the database with some premade movies and ratings.

Run the command 'rails s -p 3001'. This will start the backend server.

Then open a new terminal and allow that server to run.

Navigate to the frontend folder, and into the critic-crack folder in the new terminal.

Run 'npm install' to install dependencies needed for the frontend.

Run 'npm start' to start the frontend and load information. This should automatically open your default browser to localhost:3000. If not, open your preferred browser to this location.

Start making your own movie critiques and summaries by navigating using the drop down bar at the top!
